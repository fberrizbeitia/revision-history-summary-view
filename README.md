# Revision History Summary View
This plugin displays changes to all metadata fields (eprint attributes) in a summary view by re-rendering the information in a concise and readable format. 

A description of this plugin proposal was presented at Open Repositories 2013: https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/983967/ 

Once installed, the plugin adds a button "Revision History Summary View" for Editors, under "Actions" tab.
